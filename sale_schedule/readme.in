1.The virtual stock of the product is 0
=> It will act exactly like the make to order route.

2.The virtual stock is equal to the quantity ordered
=> It will act exactly like a make to stock route

3.The virtual stock is more than 0 but less than ordered quantity
=> On part of the products will be taken from stock and a purchase order
    will be created for the rest. So it will act like both make to order and make to stock rule.
